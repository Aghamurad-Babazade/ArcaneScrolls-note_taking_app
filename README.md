# ArcaneScrolls - Note-Taking Application 📔

ArcaneScrolls is a secure note-taking application designed to prioritize user privacy through encryption mechanisms.
Each note created is encrypted using AES-256, and user logins are protected with BCrypt hashing. Additionally, every
user has a unique encryption key secured by their password, ensuring secure note viewing, editing, and other operations.
